# GoShot (**Work in Progress**)

Convenient screenshot program that is quick, allows for very simple 
editing (cropping, drawing arrows, circles and text boxes) and exports to 
easily shareable formats (Google Drive, MS OneDrive, Dropbox, clipboard) with
as few clicks as possible.

## TODO

* Implement scrollbars on the side of the image editor: the native Fyne won't work, since they try to do all
  automatically but would expect us to have the full image rendered, which is prohibitively large at higher
  zoom levels.
  
* Export to Microsoft OneDrive, DropBox, others ?

* Stay live in the system tray.
